Being 21 and fresh out of school is fantastic.
At this point in life, your book is unwritten.

But one downside of being so young is...

## Inexperience

Experience prevents you from making costly mistakes.
That's one reason why companies pay Senior Engineers
more than their junior counterparts.
But we often overlook one big flaw with experience:

### Experience is lopsided.

The way to round it out is to learn
from the experiences of others. One way to do that is reading.
Today it's is easier than ever with the abundance of content available online.

## Taking the time

So a couple days ago I decided to allocate
time every week to filling the gaps in my knowledge.
For personal professional purposes, that means learning
how real software systems work.

I plan to read about includes databases, filesystems, distributed systems,
query planning, immutable data structures, parsing, information retrieval, and more.

## Proof

Right now you're probably skeptical. If someone claims
to have read so much, they probably just skimmed through it.
Saying that you read an article on X doesn't make you
experienced about X. It's also not the same as having direct
experience doing X.

I agree, so I'm also going
to write a post on every article I read. The post will
be a summary plus my thoughts.
The goal will be to explain the learnings of the article in a way
that's enlightening. Not only does this prove
that you read about a topic, but it also proves that you have
meaningful thoughts on it.

The most important benefit of writing
is that it forces you to iron out
the wrinkles in your understanding. The process
of learning something so you can explain it
to someone else gets you much closer to having experience
in it than just reading about it would. I'll end with
a thought from Einstein,

> If you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough.
