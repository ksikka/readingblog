Being 21 and fresh out of school is fantastic.
At this point in life, your book is unwritten.
The only caveat is...

## Inexperience

Experience prevents you from making costly mistakes.
That's one reason why companies pay Senior Engineers
more than their junior counterparts.
But we often overlook one big flaw with experience:

### Experience is lopsided.

One way to round it out is to learn
from the experiences of others, by reading.
Today it's is easier than ever with the abundance of content available online.
Experts from industry and academia have poured their thoughts and
experiences into blog posts, papers, and books.
But how often do we tap into this sea of knowledge?

## Taking the time

A couple days ago I decided to allocate
time every week to fill in the gaps of my experience.
For professional purposes, that means learning
how real software systems get built.

I plan to read about includes databases, filesystems, distributed systems,
query planning, immutable data structures, parsing, information retrieval, and more.

## Proof

Right now you're probably skeptical. If someone claims
to have read so much, they probably just skimmed through it.
Saying that you read an article on X doesn't make you
experienced about X. It's also not the same as having direct
experience doing X.

I agree, so I'm also going
to write an expository post on every article I read. The posts
will be targeted towards engineers like me who have strong fundamentals
but may lack domain expertise in the area.
The goal of each post is to teach you something new
and making you wanting more.

Not only does process this prove
that you've read about a topic, but it also proves that you have
meaningful thoughts on it.

The most important benefit of writing
is that it forces you to iron out
the wrinkles in your understanding. The process
of learning something so you can explain it
to someone else gets you much closer to having experience
in it than just reading about it would. I'll end with
a thought from Einstein,

> If you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough.
