If humans are good at anything, it's self-deception.
We say we're doing one thing with our time,
but then we turn around and do something else.
And without a written record, you wouldn't even know it.
Here's how I mitigated this problem with a time log.

----

The simplest solution to the problem of self-deception
is to write down what you do everyday and then look
at it once in a while.

Example:
```
    6/14:
      woke up at 10
      10.15-11 took the train to work
      11-12 bummed around reading internet
      12 lunch
      12.30 check tasks
      1 start working on blah
      2.30 take a break
      3.15 resume
      6 break for dinner
      6.45 work
      7.30 finish task, submit for review
      8.20 watch seinfeld
      completely bum around and sleep at 2
```

I did this for six months, and I found it extremely useful.

## What I learned

**1. Your plan to do things on the side is doomed.**

It becomes clear that if you don't take proactive
measures, all of your time will get consumed by full-time work.
It's not just the 8 hours a day you're supposed to spend there.
It's the time spent thinking about it before work,
and the time you spend recuperating from it after work.
A lot of people enter a full-time job thinking
"do what you love on the side" but it's really hard to pull off unless
you write everything down to make sure you're making progress on
what you actually want to do.

**2. Following up is easy and effective - but we forget.**

I got better at following up with people and projects.
Looking at my previous day's time log every day reminded me to follow up with
people who I otherwise wouldn't have, and to finish working on projects that I started.

Sending light messages like "hey I enjoyed meeting you yesterday"
is so downright easy, and incredibly effective. As a result,
I got more opportunities to socialize with people, and it turned
into a virtuous cycle.

The other thing I noticed as an engineer was that my tasks at work
may have been individually trivial, but over the course of months,
they added up to meaningful improvements in the product I was working on.
In contrast, the time I spent outside of work was spent on one-off activities
that didn't amount to anything. I noticed this very quickly thanks
to keeping a time log, and was able to focus on doing things that add up instead.

**3. Don't rely on your memory for anything important.**

It's no wonder we can't remember something as simple as following up with a person.
Life moves at such a fast pace in today's day in age.
The only hope we have is acknowledge the limitation of our memory,
and use external memory to bolster it.

There was a time when I relied on memory for my calendar, finances, everything.
But life is so much easier when it's all explicitly tracked in writing
so I don't _have_ to remember it.

Writing down what you did during a vacation gets you the most ROI. What's a vacation worth if
the memories only last a few months and then fade? It's a depreciating asset. When you write down
what you do, memories hold their value and accrue over time. Writing adds context to photos
so you can remember what else happened around the time a photo was taken. You can use
that memory as an anchor point to remember how you were feeling at the time, and so on.

## Discipline

By far the most common reaction when I tell people about my time log is
"wow you must be really disciplined". But this is not true at all.
Or maybe it is, for some weird definition of discipline.

All it takes is to make it a consistent habit. The way you do that
is to make it really easy, and force yourself to do it every day.

1. **Buy a nice notebook and pen.** It gets you financially invested,
    and a physical book sitting on open your desk is the best reminder.
2. **Pair it with another daily habit**, like getting your morning coffee.
3. **Enjoy it.** When writing down what you did today, look back 
    on yesterday fondly, and be satisified knowing it will be recorded forever.
4. **Build up a streak and cling to it.** Let the fear of breaking the streak drive you.

## Write your own story

It's expected to hesitate to keep or review your time log
because you may not like what you'll see.

But there's no reason to balk. If you don't like
what you see, you'll be thankful that you saved yourself
months or years of plowing ahead, wasting time.
You can change the way you spend time *now*
and in a few months, you'll *like* what you see
in you time log.

The algorithm of the time log is:
1. write it down and facepalm at your life
2. make a lifestyle change
3. see your own change in your own time log
4. feel like a million bucks

The realization is that you *can* write your own story
instead of letting your story happen to you.

But you cannot simply be told these lessons and "internalize"
or whatever. Human habits wont be moved so easily.
Especially when you have your ego to protect.
In order to *truly* learn these lessons, 
you have to see them for yourself by writing down what you do everyday.

## Final Thoughts

The bigger picture of writing everything down is that it gives you the ability
to pause, look at your trajectory, and adjust your heading.
Business owners look at their revenue numbers in quarterly board meetings.
Scientists look at their log books to write their research papers.
Time is what life consists of - shouldn't we be taking an honest look
at how we utilize it?
