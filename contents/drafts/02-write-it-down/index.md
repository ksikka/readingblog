If you're a recent grad about to take on a full time job, I beg you to ask yourself, **why**?
At 22 years old, the prime of your life, why would you sell your time and livelihood to someone else?

---------------------------------------

Despite it being the widely-accepted thing to do, the underlying reason is often practical:
to build a financial and social base while you figure out what to do next.

At least that was my answer. But my biggest fear was that I'd get engrossed in the work
and make little-to-no progress on stewing up a plan.
Stubborn to make sure that wouldnâ€™t happen, I accepted a job offer, went to work, but with a notebook in hand.

For five months, I wrote down every use of my time as if it were a ledger.
And it's one of the best things that's happened to me.

#### Benefit 1: Easy weekly status updates

At Heap, we share what we did last week and what we plan to do this week.
With everything written down in a notebook, this becomes a trivial task
that you actually look forward to, because you get to relive your week in the process.
Plus, you can do your own personal review every two months.

After a while you start to notice trends.
I noticed that I get an unusual amount done on Friday nights,
I usually relax after work instead of doing anything producive,
and my weekends are spent well, either by being social, hacking, or reading and writing.

#### Benefit 2: Improved follow-through rate

By reviewing my previous week, I'm always reminded to follow up with the people I met.
They might be friends of friends or acquaintences met at a party.

Simply sending a message to a person you enjoyed meeting
is a great way to get them to remember you, and to remember invite you the next time they plan
a weekend hike.

In general, small, high-value tasks like this usually fall through, but the simple act
of looking at your previous day's work helps you finish what you started.
That's where most of the value is anyway.

#### Benefit 3: You'll never forget

You get a wonderful feeling of security from knowing that your time has been recorded forever.

Writing down what you did during a vacation gets you the most ROI. What's a vacation worth if
the memories only last a few months and then fade? It's a depreciating asset. When you write down
what you do, memories hold their value and accrue over time. Writing adds context to photos
so you can remember what else happened around the time a photo was taken. You can use
that memory as an anchor point to remember how you were feeling at the time, and so on.

### Making it a Routine

The biggest obstacle to writing everything down is that it's hard to build a habit.
In order to make it work for you, you have to make it a routine that you're stubborn
about following. You can start by buying a nice notebook, pen, and wristwatch for two reasons:
to make time management a pleasure, and to get yourself financially invested.

After that, keep the notebook somewhere you regularly see it.
I kept it open on my desk while I worked so that as I switched tasks,
I could easily jot down what I was doing. If you forget to do this - which is ok -
the open book should remind you to backfill what you did.

Share your weekly progress with people. The more people you tell, the more
of a fool you'll look if you suddenly stop. I send "investor updates" to
my family every two months as an accountability mechanism.

### The Kicker

Imagine if the next book you picked up retold the story of your
past six months without any embellishment. First, you smile as you recount
memories that were on the verge of being forgotten.
Then, you impress yourself as you tally up all the cool things you've done.
But finally, you realize you spent the bulk of your waking hours working for someone else.

I wrote earlier that the whole point of doing this was to ensure that I was
making progress on life while I was working. Has it achieved that goal?

No. I still don't know what I'm doing, and I don't expect
logging my time to help me figure that out. But it did help me reclaim a lot of time
that I would have otherwise wasted. Writing this blog post is just one example!

It's true that writing everything down does not *directly* help you get out of local maxima
in your life.
In fact, it can encourage you to micro-optimize rather than make large trajectory changes.
These small micro-optimizations, such as making better use of your commute time,
can make you *feel* productive, but you could be missing out on something bigger.

The bigger picture of writing everything down is that it gives you the ability
to press pause, look at your trajectory, and adjust your heading.
Businesses already do this by having monthly or quarterly board meetings
where they review progress on OKRs and KPIs.
Engineers do this periodically to review the accuracy of their time estimates.
Somehow it's the norm for people to not do this - but if they did,
they'd probably have more success in growing themselves like a business.

### What's next

The past five months have sharpened my sense for time management.
But I'm starting to hit the limits of writing everything down on paper.
Using a physical book was great for developing a routine,
but now I want to be able to plan more intentionally and use a tool
to help me stay true to my plan. For that, I've developed Mojito,
which takes your desired time allotment, your queue of tasks,
and creates a weekly plan for you to follow. It's still
very experimental, but it's helped me make sure I spend time
on the right projects in the right proportion.
If it works out, it could be the subject of another post.

Hope you enjoyed reading and good luck with managing time!
