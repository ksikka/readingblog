If you're a recent grad about to take on a full time job, I beg you to ask yourself, **why**?
At 22 years old, the prime of your life, why would you sell your time and livelihood to someone else?

---------------------------------------

Despite it being the widely-accepted thing to do, the underlying reason is often practical:
to **build a financial and social base** while you figure out what to do next.

At least that was my answer. But my biggest fear was that I'd get engrossed in the work
and **make little-to-no progress** on stewing up a plan.
Stubborn to make sure that wouldnâ€™t happen, I accepted a job offer, went to work, but with a notebook in hand.

For five months, I **wrote down every use of my time** as if it were a ledger.
And then the following three things happened.

#### 1. Easy weekly status updates

At Heap, we share what we did last week and what we plan to do this week.
With everything written down in a notebook, this becomes a trivial task
that you actually look forward to, because you get to relive your week in the process.
Plus, you can do your own personal review every two months.

After a while you start to notice trends.
I noticed that I get an unusual amount done on Friday nights,
I usually watch TV after work instead of doing anything productive,
and my weekends are spent by being social, hacking, or reading and writing.

#### 2. Improved follow-through rate

By reviewing my previous week, I'm always reminded to follow up with the people I met.
They might be friends of friends or acquaintences you bump into randomly.

Simply sending a message to a person you enjoyed meeting
is a great way to get them to remember you, and to remember to invite you the next time they plan
a weekend hike.

In general, small, high-value tasks like this usually fall through, but the simple act
of looking back on your time helps you finish what you started.
That's where most of the value is anyway.

#### 3. You'll never forget

You get a wonderful feeling of security from knowing that your time has been recorded forever.

Writing down what you did during a vacation gets you the most ROI. What's a vacation worth if
the memories only last a few months and then fade? It's a depreciating asset. When you write down
what you do, memories hold their value and accrue over time. Writing adds context to photos
so you can remember what else happened around the time a photo was taken. You can use
that memory as an anchor point to remember how you were feeling at the time, and so on.

---------------------------------------

### The Kicker

If you're a working professional, writing everything down will make you confront the reality that
**you spend the bulk of your waking hours working for someone else**.

I'm not saying that working for someone else is bad.
We all have to provide a service to someone in order to make money.
But being fully aware of how much energy you spend working for someone else
definitely makes you think about what you'd rather do instead.

This is what I wanted out of writing a time log, and it works.

### Making it a Routine

The biggest hurdle in writing everything down is **discipline**.
The way to solve this problem is to make writing in your time log a routine that you're stubborn
to follow. You can start by buying a nice notebook, pen, and wristwatch for two reasons:
to **make time management a pleasure**, and to **get yourself financially invested**.

After that, keep the notebook somewhere you regularly see it.
I kept it open on my desk while I worked so that as I switched tasks,
I could easily jot down what I was doing. If you forget to do this - which is ok -
the open book should remind you to backfill what you did.

Share your weekly progress with people. The more people you tell, the more
of a fool you'll look if you suddenly stop. I send updates to
my parents every two months; they seem to enjoy it.

### Final Thoughts

The bigger picture of writing everything down is that it gives you the ability
to pause, look at your trajectory, and adjust your heading.
Businesses already do this in quarterly board meetings where they review progress on OKRs and KPIs.
Engineers do it periodically to review the accuracy of their time estimates.
If they've been doing it for years, why not us?

You might say, life is to be enjoyed, not optimized for productivity. Even then, you
should use a time log to make sure you're enjoying life to the best of your ability.
The only reason to not keep a time log is that you don't want to face the reality
that you're living suboptimally.

### What's next

The past five months have sharpened my sense for time management.
But I'm starting to hit the limits of writing everything down on paper.
Using a physical book was great for developing a routine,
but now I want to be able to plan more intentionally and use a tool
to help me stay true to my plan. For that, I've developed Mojito,
which takes your desired time allotment, your queue of tasks,
and creates a weekly plan for you to follow. It's still
very experimental, but it's helped me make sure I spend time
on the right projects in the right proportion.
If it works out, it could be the subject of another post.
