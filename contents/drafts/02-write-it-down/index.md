**Today**, you're the youngest you'll ever be.

And yet, if you have a full-time job, you're selling
your time to someone else.  Maybe the job is what you truly how you want to spend your time,
but more likely, you need the money and the job's something you could enjoy if you tried.

If you haven't guessed, I'm pretty weary of the concept of a full-time job.
The economist Keynes predicted as we become more productive as human beings, we'd work less.
But it seems the opposite happened. The more we earn, the harder we work
due to the opportunity cost of *not* working.
<!--- It seems like a psychological illness that we humans are prone to. -->

I was concerned about this when I graduated from university.
I didn't want to fall into the 9-5 hamster-wheel that we call a job.
That's why I took up the strange habit of writing down everything I did and when I did it.

I hoped that this habit would prevent me from wasting too much time at work,
but in the end, it forced me to confront the fact that as a working professional,
**you spend most of your waking hours working for someone else**.

It also fundamentally changed the way I see time and make decisions.
Writing everything down daily is probably the highest value habit you can make.
It's so simple - you just write down what you do every once in a while - and the end result
can be lifechanging.

If you're not already sold, here are the three specific lessons that
writing everything down taught me.

**1. Do things that add up.**

As an engineer, your tasks add up in a super-linear way.
One tweak alone is a small deal, but when 100s of them add up,
you get a refined, polished product that can contend in the market.

This was one reason that when I did my 2-month review, I felt that
I'd accomplished more at work than I did with my free time.
When I added up all the brunches, hikes, and reading, yes it was a great time,
but where's the impact of it all today?

**Follow up with people**

There are a handful of people I met at these random social events that
I actually ended up becoming good friends with. And I could attribute every friendship
to the fact that I followed up with them, all because I kept time log.

More often than not, we just *forget* to follow up with people.
After we leave the party and go to work, life resumes as usual.
But when you review your time log a few days later and think fondly
about the times you had with that person, you remember to shoot them a message
and that could be a life-changing move.

It's a great feeling when you remember to follow up with people
and projects *just* because you wrote down a note on a piece of paper.
It's the same feeling as unexpectedly finding money in your jacket's pocket.

**Don't let your past investments go to waste.**

It's easy to get excited by something like a new app idea
or a new book or a new blog post. The idea of starting something
new and fresh is appealing when you see its tremendous future
potential all at once as a shiny new idea in your head.

But the hard part come afterwards, when another shiny new idea
comes along and steals attention away from your old idea that
hasn't yet realized the value you expected of it when you started.

Everytime you start a new project - be it a book, blog post, feature etc - 
You're usually making the decision to leave an old investment behind.
If you're starting a blog post, you're saying "I'm done with the last blog post",
which is saying "I don't have much to gain by spending time on the last post
so I'd rather work on a new one".

In so many cases, you're better off improving a thing you've already worked on
rather than starting a new thing. If you're always starting new things,
you'll never get one thing good enough to the point where people will care.

Again, this is a really  basic lesson that you've probably heard
a million times and think you already know, but the lesson
doesn't stick until you keep a time log and witness yourself
making the mistake of starting new projects without completing old ones.
You can make it happen by changing the way you spend time.

**3. Your plan to "Do things on the side" will fail.**

Work is the thing you have to do when you wake up.
You think about it in the shower, and it's stuck
in your brain when you come home.
And if your job is intensive, you'll probably want to relax after work
instead of finding ways to be productive for yourself.
What's life if 5/7 days a week you're struggling
to do what you want with your time?

Keeping a time log forces you to see this and take action.
The solution is to prioritize your side project
above work when you're disappointed in yourself for not making enough progress.
It feels irresponsible at the time, knowing that other people might be working
and you're doing something else, but it's the only way.

If keeping a time log forces you to see this,
that means that working full-time is *designed*
to make you spend most of your life working for a company
without you **realizing** how you could be spending your time instead.
It's imperative that you keep a time log so you can at
least keep a neutral state of mind.

**Don't lean on your memory for anything**

There's an underlying theme in all of the above lessons,
and that humans suck at remember things.
Today, there's a trend towards "living in the moment",
but keeping a time log has made me realize
that when you make on-the-fly decisions,
you're living a stateless life where you're happy
in-the-moment but you're forgetting to follow up with people,
completing projects, and forgetting to look at the big picture.

Writing everything down is extremely powerful habit
outside of personal development. Written text can be shared digitally
on a large scale. It stands the test of time - it never forgets.
Studies have shown memories change slightly everytime you recall them.
It gets to the point where when you compare your own memory with
what the time log says, you're startled at the slight discrepancy.

An extension of relying on writing over memory,
is relying on data over intuition to make business decisions.
I've learned that paranoia that intuition may be wrong is healthy,
and looking at data is a good way to make sure you're not going crazy.

Checking your own senility is required, even if you're smart competent, etc.
Even the smartest, most competent person will suffer memory weaker
than writing everything down, and their intuition 
is still weaker impetus than the raw data.

**2. You *can* write your own story.**

It's expected to hesitate to keep or review your time log
because you may not like what you'll see.

But there's no reason to balk. If you don't like
what you see, you'll be thankful that you saved yourself
months or years of plowing ahead, wasting time.
You can change the way you spend time *now*
and in a few months, you'll *like* what you see
in you time log.

The algorithm of the time log is:
1. write it down and facepalm at your life
2. make a lifestyle change
3. see your own change in your own time log
4. feel like a million bucks

The realization is that you *can* write your own story
instead of letting your story happen to you.

But you cannot simply be told these lessons and "internalize"
or whatever. Human habits wont be moved so easily.
Especially when you have your ego to protect.
In order to *truly* learn these lessons, 
you have to see them for yourself by writing down what you do everyday.

**Discipline**

Writing down everything you do, every day, is a hard habit to keep.
A few actionable tips:

1. **Buy a nice notebook and pen.** It gets you financially invested,
    and a physical book sitting on open your desk is the best reminder.
2. **Pair it with another daily habit**, like getting your morning coffee.
3. **Enjoy it.** When writing down what you did today, look back 
    on yesterday fondly, and be satisified knowing it will be recorded forever.
4. **Build up a streak and cling to it.** Let the fear of breaking the streak drive you.
